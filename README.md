# Acoustic-Data-Transmission-using-Sound-waves-miniProject-
This project demonstrates a simple, low-cost method for wireless communication using acoustic signals (sound waves) instead of conventional RF technology. It enables short-range data transmission using standard audio hardware such as microphones and speakers by implementing Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation in software.
